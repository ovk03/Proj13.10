this project contains a lot of files (all made by me). 
Before trying to dive into the inner workings of this project 
i would recommend taking a look at the design document, 
especially the _"File structure"_ section, to see how the project
is structure divided.

I know this project is way too large for the given task,
but I wanted to have a little fun with a larger project.
In my opinion large projects are the best way to learn coding,
as you need to learn many new skills, that would be useless in 
smaller projects.
